# mock-exam-pg6101

## Extras 
* I have added styling with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com). This required adding css-loaders to webpack.config.js.
* Added Swagger documentation and wrapped responses on authentication API

## Assumptions
* The `movies/lb_id`-endpoint does not serve any purpose other than testing load balancing in e2e-test. 
My assumption is that this is fine in an exam, as I want to show that load-balancing is working.  
* I am sharing all DTO/ResponseDTOs in the `shared`-module even if not all of them are used in 
more than one module. My assumption is that this is OK as this approach avoids having the same 
concepts in multiple places. Moreover, it is an approach that would become better with more functionality/
services added over time.
