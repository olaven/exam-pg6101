# Exam Enterprise [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/olaven/exam-pg6101.svg?token=zTzVh5wrqM89cpyf9qVd&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/olaven/exam-pg6101)

## Documentation

### About the Application 
This aplication models a social network akin to Facebook. 

### Test information 
Some users are added by default: 
* username: "admin@mail.com", password, "admin" (is administrator)
* username: "adam@mail.com", password, "adam"
* username: "charlie@mail.com", password, "charlie" 

### Assumptions
* The `movies/lb_id`-endpoint does not serve any purpose other than testing load balancing in e2e-test. 
My assumption is that this is fine in an exam, as I want to show that load-balancing is working.
* To authorize users, I am using `Authentication` as an argument to endpoint-functions instead of the method-based
approach shown in class. This is because it gave me easy and readable access to the dto-object. My assumption is 
that this is OK because the same functionality is achieved, and it is still achieved with Spring Security. 
* I have removed the basic-auth setup that was shown during class, as it caused an annoying login-popup in the browser. 
My assumption is that this is OK, as login with body is still supported.
* The assignment states that there should be an API to handle user details. Since this is a requirement before B-grades/security,
I am assuming that this API should be a separate one, and not part of an auth-service. I.e. I am assuming that it 
should have the same role that the movies-API did in the mock-exam.
* In my JSON Merge Patch implementation, I am allowing the user to enter null-values for `.givenName` and `.familyName`. 
This is redundant, as it will result in a `ConstraintViolation` (i.e. 400). I have chosen to implement it anyway, 
for the sake of showing how JSON Merge Patch treats null values. 
* The assignment specifies "messages". As an E requirement (C in frontend) a user should be able to 
create a message for _some user_. It is not clear to me wether the "current user" is the logged in user 
or the displayed user. However, in B requirement, it is specified that a user should only be able to 
create a user for his/her own timeline. As B is a later requirements, I am considering that the valid 
interpretation. As a result, I am assuming that a message should only be sent by the user "owning" the timeline. 
 
 
### Extras 
* I have added styling with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com). This required adding css-loaders to webpack.config.js.
* Added Swagger documentation and wrapped responses on authentication API
* The project is running on Travis-CI

- [ ] This information should change what type of advertisement 
the user receives

    
### Delivery checklist

- [ ] run `mvn clean`
- [ ] remove `node_modules`
- [ ] ensure that `target`/`node_modules` is removed 
- [ ] zip project folder to `.zip`
- [ ] ensure that folder size is < 10MB
- [ ] rename folder to pg6100_ID_FROM_WIZEFLOW.zip
