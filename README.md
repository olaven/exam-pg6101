# Exam Enterprise [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/olaven/exam-pg6101.svg?token=zTzVh5wrqM89cpyf9qVd&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/olaven/exam-pg6101)

## Documentation

### About the Application 

### Test information 
Some users are added by default: 
* username: "admin@mail.com", password, "admin" (is administrator)
* username: "adam@mail.com", password, "adam"
* username: "charlie@mail.com", password, "charlie" 

### Extras 
* I have added styling with [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com). This required adding css-loaders to webpack.config.js.
* Added Swagger documentation and wrapped responses on authentication API
* The project is running on Travis-CI

### Assumptions
* The `movies/lb_id`-endpoint does not serve any purpose other than testing load balancing in e2e-test. 
My assumption is that this is fine in an exam, as I want to show that load-balancing is working.
* To authorize users, I am using `Authentication` as an argument to endpoint-functions instead of the method-based
approach shown in class. This is because it gave me easy and readable access to the dto-object. My assumption is 
that this is OK because the same functionality is achieved, and it is still achieved with Spring Security. 
* I have removed the basic-auth setup that was shown during class, as it caused an annoying login-popup in the browser. 
My assumption is that this is OK, as login with body is still supported.
* The assignment states that there should be an API to handle user details. Since this is a requirement before B-grades/security,
I am assuming that this API should be a separate one, and not part of an auth-service. I.e. I am assuming that it 
should have the same role that the movies-API did in the mock-exam.
* In my JSON Merge Patch implementation, I am allowing the user to enter null-values for `.givenName` and `.familyName`. 
This is redundant, as it will result in a `ConstraintViolation` (i.e. 400). I have chosen to implement it anyway, 
for the sake of showing how JSON Merge Patch treats null values.

### Startup checklist 
- [X] Go through entire task, setting up main checklist 
- [X] Think about the schema -> keep it simple

    - [X] PATCH (JSON merge patch)
    - [X] DELETE
- [X] Wrapped Responses
- [X] Pagination 
- [X] Swagger Doc
- [X] One test per endpoint 
- [X] Using postgres in production 
- [X] Flyway 
- [X] at least 70% test coverage

##### Application
- [X] API for user details (bruk custom security funksjon) 
- [X] Friendship requests
- [X] Messages on a users timeline 
- [X] Providing default data
#### D mark
##### General
- [X] single entrypoint is gateway 
- [X] whole app started with docker compose 
- [ ] e2e _for each_ REST API
##### Application 
nothing.
#### C mark 
##### General
- [X] Provide a frontend
- [ ] all major features in app is executable from frontend
##### Application 
- [ ] GUI
    - [ ] Search and display users
    - [ ] Register a new user 
    - [ ] See details of other users 
    - [ ] Post on other users timeline
    - [ ] Display messages sorted by time (sort in DB!)
    - [ ] Create and accept friend requests 
#### B mark 
##### General
- [X] Security protecting REST API
- [X] Security is session based, through redis
- [ ] frontend can signup/sign in user
##### Application 
- [ ] Login/logout -> handled by other API 
- [ ] Logged in user should see a welcome message
- [ ] A user can create message on their own timeline
    - [ ] A test to verify this
- [ ] Sikkerhet pÃ¥ timeline 
- [ ] A user should see timelines of friends (in separate view -> assumption?)
    - [ ] A test to verify this 
#### A mark 
##### General
- [ ] Provide graphQL endpoint 
    - [ ] at least one mutation
    - [ ] at least one query
- [ ] Communication between two services, with AMQP
##### Application 
- [ ] GraphQL should handle advertisements
- [ ] Display advertisements on home-page
- [ ] Accepted requests shoud send a message to GQL, 
- [ ] This information should change what type of advertisement 
the user receives

    
### Delivery checklist
- [ ] Make sure that Swagger doc is available
- [ ] Make sure that only gateway is exposed on `./docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] Make sure that jpa is always set to `validate`
- [ ] Run project with `mvn clean verify`
- [ ] run `mvn clean`
- [ ] remove `node_modules`
- [ ] ensure that `target`/`node_modules` is removed 
- [ ] zip project folder to `.zip`
- [ ] ensure that folder size is < 10MB
- [ ] rename folder to pg6100_ID_FROM_WIZEFLOW.zip
